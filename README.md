## Description
Using Angular, build the client-side for an app called popcornHub based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

## Objective 
By the end of the project, youâ€™ll have a complete web app (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript technologies. This project will demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development. The complete tech stack to master includes the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## How to get the project running
1. Create a directory in your local computer:`mkdir <name_your_directory>`
2. Clone the GitHub repository using the command: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Run the development server: `ng serve`
7. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/`
